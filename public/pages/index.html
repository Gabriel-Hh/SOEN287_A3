				As a computer science student with a passion for low-level systems, backend designs, and data science, my goal is to become a skilled software engineer. I want to work on complex and challenging projects that require me to apply my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills. My ultimate aim is to contribute to the development of efficient and scalable systems that can handle large amounts of data and provide valuable insights.

		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p  class="hidden" style="background-color: yellow;">
				A brief bio (or summary) about yourself and your potentials, using the &lt;div&gt; tag or any tag of your choice. Hence, the textual data/information must be justify-aligned with respect to the webpage layout (1 point).
			</p>

			<p>
				I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science and have taken several courses in systems programming, databases, and data structures. I have also gained hands-on experience through various projects and internships where I have worked on developing and maintaining backend systems. I have a strong interest in the field of data science and am eager to learn more about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am a dedicated and hard-working individual who is constantly seeking new opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge in the field of computer science.
