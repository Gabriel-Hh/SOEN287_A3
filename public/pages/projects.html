			(i) A list of all the projects (publications, term projects, research, etc.) you have accomplished in the past ten (10) years, using the &lt;ol&gt; tag or any tag of your choice, which must be justify-aligned with respect to the layout of your webpage. Additionally, this list MUST be in descending order (using Roman numerals in descending order). In other words, your projectsâ€™ list should start with the most recent to the oldest (2.5 points).

			From low-level systems to backend designs, and data science, I have gained hands-on experience and developed a strong set of technical skills. My projects demonstrate my passion for finding innovative solutions to complex problems and my commitment to continuously learning and growing in the field of computer science. Whether you are interested in my technical abilities, my problem-solving skills, or simply want to see what I have been working on, I invite you to explore this page and learn more about my projects.
